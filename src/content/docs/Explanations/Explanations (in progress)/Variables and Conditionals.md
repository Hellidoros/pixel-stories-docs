explain how conditionals and variables work

- variables are added to the game and globally scoped. This means they can be set and accessed at any time in the game.
- When we create variables, they can take on 3 types: switch, text, number
  - switch is a true/false
- note: Ensure that variables have a distinct name that describes their purpose. It can be easy to lose track of your variables!
- the set variable event is used to set the value of the variables in the game
- the way these variables are used is through conditionals. Learn more about them here!
