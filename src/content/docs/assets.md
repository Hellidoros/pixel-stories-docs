title: Default Game Assets
description: Free default assets to help get started!
---
Our vision is to facilitate creativity and empower unique storytelling through video games. However, art and assets can be hard to come by! So we provide a range of default assets that can be used to build prototypes, proof of concepts, or serve as placeholders until your custom art is ready. 

## How to Use the Assets

1. **Download the Assets**: Navigate to the download section and get the assets you need.
2. **Import into Your Project**: Use the assets to create terrains, map objects, animations and characters. 
3. **Replace When Ready**: Assets in the engine can be easily swapped out for custom art once they're ready!

**Note:** 
Some assets have been made easy to import into Pixel Stories. However, if you are using the source tilesets or spritesheets directly:
- **Terrains from tilesets**: rearrange the tiles' layout so they are compatible with terrain import (RPG Maker, Wang layout, and so on).
- **Map object or animation from spritesheet**: use a drawing tool's rectangle select to copy and paste the section into Pixel Stories.

Feel free to reach out on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/XN9EaUh26g) if you have any questions or need assistance with using the assets. Happy developing!
