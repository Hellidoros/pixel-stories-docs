title: Default Game Assets
description: Free default assets to help get started!

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Our vision is to facilitate creativity and empower unique storytelling through video games. However, art and assets can be hard to come by! So we provide some default assets that can be used to build prototypes, proof of concepts, or serve as placeholders until your custom art is ready.

Keep in mind, all assets in the engine are replaceable at any time. So don't feel locked in to a specific style!

## How to Use the Assets

<Steps>

1. Download the assets you need.
2. Import them into your Project. <br/>
   - Use the assets to create terrains, map objects, animations and characters.
3. Replace when ready. <br/>
   - Assets in the engine can be easily swapped out for custom art once they're ready.

</Steps>

**Note:**
Some assets have been made easy to import into Pixel Stories. However, if you are using the source tilesets or spritesheets directly:

- For terrains from tilesets, rearrange the tiles' layout so they are compatible with terrain import (RPG Maker, Wang layout, and so on).
- For map objects, use a drawing tool's rectangle select to copy and paste the section into Pixel Stories.
- Animations are in the format of sprite strips. If it's from a spritesheet, use a drawing tool to copy out the sprite strip row.

Feel free to reach out on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/XN9EaUh26g) if you have any questions or need assistance with using the assets. Happy developing!
