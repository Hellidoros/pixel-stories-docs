### Auto Tiling with Terrains

One of the standout features of the map editor is its auto-tiling capability. Auto tiling simplifies the process of creating complex and visually cohesive maps by automatically adjusting tiles based on their surroundings.

#### How Auto Tiling Works

Auto tiling uses a source tile set to determine how each tile connects with its neighboring tiles. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Source Tile Set**: A collection of tiles that includes all possible connections and variations needed to create seamless transitions between different tiles.
2. **Inference**: The auto-tiling system analyzes the source tile set to understand how tiles should connect to one another. It identifies patterns and rules for tile placement.
3. **Tile Set Layouts**: There are different types of source tile set layouts available. You can select the one that best fits your design needs. Common layouts include square grids, hexagonal grids, and more.
4. **Automatic Generation**: Once a source tile set and layout are selected, the auto tile set is automatically generated. This ensures that when you place tiles in the map editor, they will automatically adjust to fit together seamlessly, reducing the need for manual adjustments and ensuring a polished look.
