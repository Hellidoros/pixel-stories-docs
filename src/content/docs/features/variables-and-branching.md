How variables work
- variables are added to the game and globally scoped. This means they can be set and accessed at any time in the game. They are created at `Game assets > Variables` . 
- When we create variables, they can take on 3 types: switch (true/false), text, number
- note: Ensure that variables have a distinct name that describes their purpose. It can be easy to lose track of your variables!

Setting the variable in game
- the set variable event is used to set the value of the variables in the game
- the way these variables are used is through conditionals. Learn more about them here!

Variables are used accompanying conditional branches to create multiple endings and choices matter scenarios. They can even be used in an immersive way beyond dialog options, where the variable is set based on the player's direction action. For example, whether they walk one in way or the other, or when they interact to perform an action over another.
