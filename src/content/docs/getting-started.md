Pixel Stories is a no-code game engine designed specifically for story-driven adventures games. Our game engine can be launched in any modern web browser. The engine is free and in early access alpha. You can jump right into the engine <a href="https://app.pixelstories.io" target="_blank">here</a>!

## Introductory Tutorial

This tutorial will get you familiar with the engine's interface and basic tasks. It covers creating a map with terrain and objects, adding animations and actors, as well as a bit of the event system. Start with the [getting started tutorial](../tutorials/basic) if it's your first time using Pixel Stories.

## Why Pixel Stories

You might be wondering why you should use Pixel Stories over RPG Maker, GameMaker Studio, Construct 3, or Godot. Pixel Stories is unique in that it's a modern engine built from the ground up to be for story-driven games. See [Why Pixel Stories?](../why-pixel-stories)
