In this tutorial, we will be creating a story which includes two maps, using the transfer event to connect them, and implementing multiple endings into the game.

From the basics tutorial, we learned [how to create maps with terrains](basic-pixel-stories). This time, we're going to add more details in our map by using layers. We'll use the following assets to create grass, a road, and a house to create the first map.

TODO: insert assets, grass and road terrain, and house object

With the grass terrain, fill in a big rectangle for the background in the map. Now create a new layer under the `Terrain Layers` section. Select the new layer so it's active and we can draw in a road on top of the grass.

TODO: insert picture of map with grass and road

Now we can add the house. Add and select the object to place it next to the road.

TODO: insert picture of final map

With the first map ready, 

this is too much for the learner. take out some stuff, maybe use the first project continued.

Make a second map,
Connecting your two maps
Adding a puzzle 
Doing multiple endings, two ways:
* Add two maps which contain events for each ending, switch the transfer player event. Good for bigger divergences from main branch. 
* Adding a conditional branch to play different events. Good for granular control.
