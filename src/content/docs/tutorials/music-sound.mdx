In your game, you can control when the background music changes or stops by using the `Set background music` and `Stop background music` events.

## Playing Sound

Next, we’ll create an event that plays a sound when the player walks over a specific area.

<Steps>

1. Create a new event group and name it “Play sound”.
2. In the event group:
