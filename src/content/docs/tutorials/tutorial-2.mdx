import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

With our map and characters created, now we can add some dialog. After all, they are the bread and butter of story-driven games!

## Showing Dialog

The dialog event shows text in a dialog box in the game.

### Dialog Format

Dialog is written in a specific format. Each line within the text area represents a new dialog box in the game. The word within the bracket adds a name for the dialog. The name will display in the dialog box until it is changed or reset with empty brackets `[]`.

### Adding Dialog

<Steps>

1. Navigate to `Maps > Map 1 > Events`.
2. Click `+ Event` and add the `Dialog` event.
3. In the event configuration: <br/>
   Paste the following dialog text:

   ```
   Hello World
   [Joe]
   This is written by Joe.
   Hello from Joe!
   []
   Joe doesn't want to talk.
   ```

4. Navigate to `Play test` and we should see the dialog play. <br/>
   Press `Enter` or `X` to play the next dialog.

</Steps>

:::note

Events play one after another. So if you had an actor move event before the dialog, the dialog only shows after the actor is finished moving.

:::

## Adding an Interaction

Our current set up will play the dialog event when the map loads. But what if we want to play dialog when the player interacts with something? To do this, let's add an event group.

### How Event Groups Work

To make the senario possible, it's important to understand how event groups work. Once you know how to use event groups, they will be the most powerful feature in your toolkit.

Event groups are simply a group of events separate from the map's initial events. The map's initial events play one after another when the map loads. To play the event group's events, we must add it to the map with the `Add event group` event. When it's time to remove the event group from the map, we can use the `Remove event group` event.

:::note

An event group's events will never play until they are added into the map with an `Add event group` event!

:::

When an event group is added with the `Add event group` event, they can be triggered via:

- `Interact`, the player is next to event group and presses `Enter` or `X` to trigger it.
- `Touch`, the player walks up to the event group tile.
- `None`, event group plays immediately when added.

We can imagine a map having many event groups. With this system, it's possible to build puzzles, dynamic interactions, and interesting story game mechanics.

The follow is a sketch of a map which has several event groups added in:

### New Event Group

<Steps>

1. Navigate to `Maps > Map 1 > Events` at the `Event groups` section.
2. Click `+ Create event group`.
3. Click the name to rename the event group as "Talking tree."
4. Add a new dialog event in the event group: <br/>
   Paste the following dialog text:

   ```
   Hello World!
   This is the tree talking.
   ```

5. Under the `Map Events` section <br/>
   Add an event and choose the `Add event group` event.
   - Select `Talking tree` for the event group to play.
   - Set the trigger type to interact.
   - Set the trigger position to a tree in the map.

</Steps>

Now head over to `Play test` and use `Arrow keys` or `WASD` to walk up to the tree. When we press `Enter` or `X`, we should see the dialog play.

One thing to note, the event group will not be added until the other events are finished playing.

## That's All For Now!

Thanks for going through this tutorial! We've gone through creating our map with terrain and objects, adding animations and actors, as well as a bit of the event system. [Join our community on Discord](https://discord.gg/XN9EaUh26g) if you'd like to get more help or give feedback/suggestions.

Good luck in your game creation journey with Pixel Stories!
