Pixel Stories is the game engine designed from the ground up for building top down pixel style story-driven games. We make it easy to add characters, build the game world, create adventures, and have multiple endings. Our game engine leverages modern web technologies and design philosophies to create the best experience for the user. If you are looking to place your focus more on character design, rich narratives, and world-building, then Pixel Stories is for you.

## Features

Pixel Stories has the standard features, by default, to create story-rich pixel games:

- **Map Editor**: Our intuitive map editor allows you to easily design and customize your game world.
- **Actors**: Add and manage characters within your game.
- **Events System**: Control your story in the game with events. Trigger events based on player actions, or other conditions to create an interactive game world.
- **Story Progression and Multiple Endings**: Build branching storylines and design multiple paths and endings depending on player choices. 

## Ease of Use

One of the primary goals of Pixel Stories is to eliminate the tedious workflows commonly found in other game engines. We focus on the user experience because we know that a bad user experience leads to frustration and hinders creativity.

Pixel Stories streamlines the development process, allowing you to focus on the narrative, world-building, and character design. Our intuitive interfaces, comprehensive tools, and efficient workflows ensure that even those new to game development can create high-quality, immersive games with ease.
