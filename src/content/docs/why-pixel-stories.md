## Engine Features

Pixel Stories has the standard features, by default, to create story-rich games. Below are some of the main features.

### Map Editor

Our intuitive map editor allows you to easily design and customize your game world. Make edits on the fly and build the world as your story evolves.

### Events System

Control your story in the game with events. Trigger events based on player actions, or other conditions to create an interactive game world.

## Ease of Use

One of the primary goals of Pixel Stories is to eliminate the tedious workflows commonly found in other game engines. We focus on the user experience because we know that a bad user experience leads to frustration and hinders creativity.
