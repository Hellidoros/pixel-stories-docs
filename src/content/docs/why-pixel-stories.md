Pixel Stories is the no-code game engine designed from the ground up for building top down pixel style story-driven games. We make it easy to add characters, build the game world, create adventures, and have multiple endings. Our game engine leverages modern web technologies and design philosophies to create the best experience for the user. If you are looking to place your focus more on character design, rich narratives, and world-building, then Pixel Stories is for you.

## A Focus on the Creator

One of the primary goals of Pixel Stories is to eliminate the tedious workflows commonly found in other game engines. We focus on the user experience because we know that a bad user experience leads to frustration and hinders creativity.

Pixel Stories streamlines the game creation process, allowing you to focus on the narrative, world-building, and character design. Our intuitive interfaces, comprehensive tools, and efficient workflows ensure that even those new to game development can create high-quality, immersive games with ease.

## Engine Features
